# Functional Vasicek Model  

This folder contains the code to replicate the experiments presented in our preprint, *[Functional Vasicek Model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384598436_Functional_Vasicek_Model)*.  

## Overview  
The Functional Vasicek Model extends the classic Vasicek model to a functional setting, providing a new framework for modeling and analyzing stochastic processes. This code accompanies the theoretical results and empirical studies discussed in the preprint.
